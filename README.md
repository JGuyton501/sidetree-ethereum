That's great!  We try to adhere to the Git branching model described in https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

Checkout the `dev` branch and create a new feature/bug fix branch off of that.  Create PRs that point back to `dev`. At certain points (tbd exactly when) we will merge `dev` into `master`.
